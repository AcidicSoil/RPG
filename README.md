**Reusable cheat sheet — “Key ideas & how to apply them.”**

Analysis of Novelty Examples The novelty cases illustrate two key observations. First, novelty captures meaningful
extensions rather than random noise: in MLKit-Py, we see coherent additions such as Prophet forecasting, STL
decomposition, and genetic programming feature synthesis, while in StatModeler new capabilities include vector
autoregression and Cox proportional hazards models. Second, the new functionalities proposed by the RPG remain
reasonable within the target domain: they extend statistical modeling, optimization, or robustness analysis in ways
that align with real-world software evolution. Together, these examples confirm that the RPG supports not only stable
replication of reference repositories but also the introduction of coherent and domain-consistent innovations.



Graph guidance structures localization into systematic search. Figure 13 shows that with graph guidance,
localization behavior follows a structured CCG pattern (Coarse Search → Content Inspection → Global Graph Exploration).

 The agent begins by traversing the RPG at a coarse level to identify high-level candidates, then inspects
content-rich nodes for detailed signals, and finally explores semantically related structures across the graph. Termination
calls rise as the search converges. This progression indicates that the RPG reshapes the agent’s behavior into a
systematic, relation-aware search process, replacing ad hoc or repetitive probing.
